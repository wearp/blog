Hi there, I'm **Will Earp**. I'm a software engineer who likes building stuff for the web.

I'm at home with Python, Flask, Django, GraphQL, PostgreSQL and Redis. But have been known to dabble in JavaScript, React, Docker, Kubernetes and so on.

I live by the sea in the French city of [Saint-Malo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint-Malo) with my
wife and two young children.
