Hi there, I'm **Will Earp**. I'm a software developer who likes building stuff for the web.

I'm at home with Python, Flask, Django, GraphQL, PostgreSQL and Redis. But have been known to dabble in JavaScript, React, Docker, Kubernetes and so on.

I live by the sea in the French city of [Saint-Malo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint-Malo) with my
wife and two young children. 

If you want to contact me, you can find me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/willearp/), [GitHub](https://github.com/wearp) or [Twitter](https://twitter.com/traouglad). You can also find me on [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/users/3420838/wearp) and [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/user/xor6it) should you wish.
